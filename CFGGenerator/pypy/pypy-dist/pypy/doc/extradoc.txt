Talks and Presentations 
----------------------------------

Talks in 2006
+++++++++++++

* `PyPy's VM Approach`_ talk, given by Armin Rigo at the Dynamic Languages
  Symposium at OOPSLA'06 (Portland OR), and by Samuele Pedroni at Intel
  Hillsboro (OR)  (October). The talk presents the paper 
  `PyPy's approach to virtual machine construction`_ accepted for 
  the symposium.

* `PyPy Status`_ talk, given by Samuele Pedroni at the Vancouner
  Python Workshop 2006 (August). 

* `Trouble in Paradise`_: the Open Source Project PyPy, 
  EU-funding and Agile Practices talk, by Bea During at
  Agile 2006 (experience report).

*  `Sprint Driven Development`_, Agile Methodologies in a
   Distributed Open Source Project (PyPy) talk, by Bea During
   at XP 2006 (experience report).
      
* `Kill -1`_: process refactoring in the PyPy project talk, by Bea During
  at the Agile track/Europython 2006.

* `What can PyPy do for you`_, by Armin Rigo and Carl Friedrich Bolz given at
  EuroPython 2006. The talk describes practical usecases of PyPy.

* `PyPy 3000`_, a purely implementation-centered lightning talk at EuroPython
  2006, given by Armin Rigo and Holger Krekel.

* `PyPy introduction at EuroPython 2006`_, given by Michael Hudson, also
  stating the status of the project.

* Very similar to the EuroPython intro talk (but somewhat older) is the
  `PyPy intro`_ talk, given by Michael Hudson at ACCU 2006 (April) 

* `PyPy development method`_ talk, given by Bea During and
  Holger Krekel at Pycon2006 

Talks in 2005
+++++++++++++


* `PyPy - the new Python implementation on the block`_, 
  given by Carl Friedrich Bolz and Holger Krekel at the 
  22nd Chaos Communication Conference in Berlin, Dec. 2005. 
  
* `Open Source, EU-Funding and Agile Methods`_, given by Holger Krekel
  and Bea During at the 22nd Chaos Communication Conference in Berlin, Dec. 2005

* `Sprinting the PyPy way`_, an overview about our sprint methodology, given by
  Bea During during EuroPython 2005

* `PyCon 2005`_ animated slices, mostly reporting on the translator status.

* `py lib slides`_ from the py lib talk at PyCon 2005 
  (py is used as a support/testing library for PyPy). 

Talks in 2004
+++++++++++++

* `EU funding for FOSS`_ talk on Chaos Communication
  Conference in Berlin, Dec 2004. 

Talks in 2004
+++++++++++++

* oscon2003-paper_ an early paper presented at Oscon 2003 describing 
  what the PyPy project is about and why you should care. 

* `Architecture introduction slides`_ a mostly up-to-date
  introduction for the Amsterdam PyPy-Sprint Dec 2003.
