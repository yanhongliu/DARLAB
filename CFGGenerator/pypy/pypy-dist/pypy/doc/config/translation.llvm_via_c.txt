This options compiles LLVM code by using llc to convert it to C, then
using gcc to compile this C instead of using LLVM's own code
generators.  This generally results in better performance
(particularly when using :config:`translation.profopt` to use gcc's
profile-directed optimizations) but takes rather longer and uses more
RAM.
