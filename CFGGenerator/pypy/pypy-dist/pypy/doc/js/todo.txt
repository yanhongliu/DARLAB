Some todo list
--------------

* Complete the test coverage (rclass, rlist and friends)

* Make a tutorial somewhat usable

* Optimizations

  - names usage

  - empty/trivial blocks

  - unnecessary jumps

* Provide some high level widgets-like functionality

* Adhere to a new external function interface

* Support bound methods as arguments for callbacks.

  - if you pass a bound method to a callback, this method is called
    with previously bound self

  - if you provide an unbound method for a callback, this is an error,
    unless class is proper to the callback object (or high level class
    apropriate for that DOM object), in which case a bound method is
    called with apropriate self.

  - I'm quite sure this can be done using RPython, but I'm totally unsure
    how much effort this will require :-) (as usuall)

* Cleanup of parent namespace (put all builtin functions into it's 
  own namespace?)

* Dict support is very limited (only string keys right now)

* Implement possible raising expressions int\_add\_ovf ie.

* Make JS backend complete
