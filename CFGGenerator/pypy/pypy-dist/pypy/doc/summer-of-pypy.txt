Summer of PyPy
=======================

Open Call for Proposals for PyPy!
-----------------------------------

If you are a student and would like to work in an area related
to PyPy (there are tons of them :-)) you may consider applying
for reimbursement of your travel+expenses for attending PyPy sprints.  
For this you need to come up with a brief synopsis/proposal that contains: 

- a clear description of intended work 
- one or more deliverables with an estimated timeframe 
- your background and why you'd like to tackle it 

To help you with preparing your proposal you can 
chat to some developers first (on #pypy irc.freenode.net) or 
post to ``pypy-dev at codespeak net`` and ask for feedback.  

You may want to check out `project ideas`_ to get some inspiration. 

The resulting synopsis should be sent to `pypy-tb at codespeak net` 
from which you should get feedback after some days. There is no particular
deadline. 

In case your proposal is accepted you will get an assigned
mentor who will give concrete feedback on questions and code -
apart from the fact that you can always use the IRC channel or
pypy-dev for discussions/help. 

Accepted students can attend sprints and get reimbursements 
for travel and accomodation costs.

Procedural details
-----------------------

As an accepted student you should register early for PyPy sprints 
(see the according announcements sent to pypy-dev)
which usually get announced on the developer mailing list.  It's
possible that not all sprint participations can be funded but 
currently there are not a priori limits. 

Note that - similar to Google's Summer of code - there are hardly
any restrictions for participating: you can make use of your
work in other contexts as well apart from the fact that
you need to license your works under the MIT license. 

If you have any questions regarding procedural details
(travels, receipts, filling out the template, etc.) 
please send mail to ``pypy-sop at codespeak net``. 


getting reimbursements
++++++++++++++++++++++

For getting reimbursements you must collect your travel receipts 
(train/plane tickets etc.).  For each sprint you need
to fill out a template that will be send to you after
your proposal got accepted.  We aim at getting 
reimbursements to your bank account after each two sprints. 

Currently the reimbursements are determined and 
calculated like this: 

 * full reimbursement for travel costs (flights, train etc.)
 * per-diem of 80 Euro per Day for accomodation
 * per-diem of 40 Euro per Day for food 

However, if you do not fulfil the tasks described in 
your proposal the actual reimbursements may get reduced.
