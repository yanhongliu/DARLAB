========================================================================


Basics
-----------------

*Loop Tree* = tree of operations.  Its root (i.e. start) corresponds to
a ``can_enter_jit`` marker, so it is when an application-level loop was
closed.  Its branches end in a JUMP going either back to the head of the
same loop tree, or to the head of another one.


Perfect Specialization
-------------------------------

In theory, Perfect Specialization of a sequence of operations forming a
loop means the following:

* find how much of the input arguments' structure is needed;
* find how much structure the output arguments have;
* do the intersection.

The input arguments' structure is the most precise structure that works
for all branches.  It describes how much information, at most, we would
like to have at the root.

The output arguments' structure is, similarly, the most precise
structure that correctly describes the output of all branches.  It
describes how much information, at most, we can pass to the next
iteration.

More precisely, we use the following *specnode* classes to represent
the level of specialization::

    .       VirtualSpec(cls, name1=spec1, ...)
                    |
                 NotSpec

For example, ``VirtualSpec(W_IntObject, value = NotSpec))`` describes a
variable which is a virtual ``W_IntObject``, containing a value that is
a real integer.


Overall Approach
-----------------------------

Start tracing:

1. when we interpret normally and see a ``can_enter_jit`` marker often
   enough;

2. or when a guard in the running machine code fails often enough.

Stop tracing when we encounter the next ``can_enter_jit``.

Call "the old ``can_enter_jit``" the ``can_enter_jit`` that we started
with in case 1, or the one that is at the start of the existing loop
before the guard failure in case 2.  If the old and the new
``can_enter_jit`` are not at the same bytecode position, we are not
seeing a loop at all; this is a corner case for now (let's see later).
We will assume that the bytecode position is the same for the sequel.

Call "the loop" the sequence of instructions from the old
``can_enter_jit`` to the new one.  In the case 2 above, this means that
we must insert into the loop all unoptimized operations that go before
the guard failure; this is necessary to see a complete loop.

Apply Perfect Specialization to the loop.

Case A: We are seeing a new loop header (i.e. we did not see before this
combination of specnodes at this bytecode position).  Compile the new
loop completely, and jump to it.

Case B: We get the same specnodes as a previously-compiled loop (which
may be the same loop as the one we started with, or not).  Compile only
a bridge, going from the guard failure to the new loop head.  If we were
in case 1 above, the "guard failure" is actually the start from the
interpreter; so this combination of cases means compile a bridge going
efficiently from the interpreter (with no specialization) to the loop
in machine code (with specialization).
